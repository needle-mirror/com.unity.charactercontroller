# Get started

The Character Controller package contains pre-made character prefabs and sample projects that you can use as the basis for your own character controllers.

## Standard character prefabs

The best way to get started with the Character Controller package is to import the **Standard Characters** into your project. These are available in the **Samples** tab of the Character Controller package's page in the Package Manager window (**Window > Package Manager**).

These contain first-person and third-person character prefabs and code that can serve as a starting point for your custom character controller implementation. For more information, see the following pages:

* [First-person character setup](get-started-first-person.md)
* [Third-person character setup](get-started-third-person.md)
* [Standard characters implementation overview](get-started-implementation-overview.md)


## Tutorial

A full step-by-step tutorial on setting up and customizing character controllers is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/CharacterControllerSamples/blob/master/_Documentation/tutorial.md).

The tutorial also includes a section on how to network the standard characters with the Unity Netcode package.


## Sample projects

Full sample projects using this character controller are also available [on GitHub](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/CharacterControllerSamples). These include:

 * **Basic**: A basic character playground containing various obstacles and physics objects.
 * **StressTest**: A project where you can experiment with the performance of characters.
 * **Platformer**: A demonstration of an extended character controller with different kinds of movement features.
 * **OnlineFPS**: A demonstration of an online first-person shooter game using client-predicted character movement.

Documentation covering the sample projects in more detail is available in the samples repository.
