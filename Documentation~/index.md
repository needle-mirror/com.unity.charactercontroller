# Character Controller package

The Character Controller package provides mechanisms for creating character controllers with Unity's [Entity Component System (ECS)](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@latest). A character controller allows you to quickly configure common character movement, such as walking, jumping, and character collision.


## Installation

To install this package, [install it by its name](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-quick.html) (com.unity.charactercontroller) from the Package Manager window.
