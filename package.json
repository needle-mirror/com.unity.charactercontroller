    "changelog": "### Added\n\n### Changed\n* Refactoring of \"Standard Characters\" sample in order to make them easier to convert to netcode.\n* Uniform scaling of character entities at runtime, using the `LocalTransform.Scale` value, is now supported. Note that since characters are physics objects, any uniform scale set in authoring will be baked to an entity with a `LocalTransform.Scale` of 1.\n* `KinematicCharacterAspect` query functions now take character scale as parameter.\n* Removed core character components from the required entity query for character interpolation system updates. This allows any entity with `CharacterInterpolation` and transform components to re-use the character's interpolation strategy.\n\n### Fixed\n* Added checks to validate the presence of components on entities before accessing them in `KinematicCharacterDeferredImpulsesJob`\n* Changed fixed-step character interpolation job to take into account only entities with the enabled `Simulate` component (fixed interpolation issue in netcode contexts).\n* Fixed an incorrect calculation of character decollision vectors under certain circumstances.\n\n### Removed\n* The `KinematicCharacterVariableUpdateGroup` was removed, since there are cases where it is important for this group to be user-defined in order to have better control over when it updates. In order to replace it, add these rules to your systems (or create a new systems group that has these rules):\n    * `[UpdateInGroup(typeof(SimulationSystemGroup))]`\n    * `[UpdateAfter(typeof(FixedStepSimulationSystemGroup))]`\n    * `[UpdateBefore(typeof(TransformSystemGroup))]`\n\n### Security"
